US Retail Sales Forecast with Bayesian Approach

Case Study – Forecasting US Retail Sales
Knowing how the macro economy is trending helps investment teams formulate recommendations and put things in context.  
QED has high frequency (daily data delivered weekly) credit and debit card spending data. 
I will use that data to predict Advanced Retail Sales, which are reported monthly with one month lag (i.e. July month data is reported mid-August).
In the attached folder there are two parquet files – one, which is a historical time series of retail sales from the Fred database and the second, which is data from our credit and debit card transaction panel.
The task is to build a model that can be used to predict retail sales for the latest month period.  

I will need to conduct some Exploratory Data Analysis and then build and test a model.  

The model will be Bayesian forecast presented with uncertainty. 
Then, wrapping all these into a  pipeline and some analysis of how different models performed will also be presented.
